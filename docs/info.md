## Scope of the project
 Website where customer come to post what they want and the supplyoer will come to offer the product.

### problem statment
 - people want stuff but don't know where to buy
 - people are lazy so they want easy way to buy stuff

## Vision Statement
 We want to shif the demand supply system. In the past the supplier will be the one who sell stuff to a middle man. then the middle man will sell stuff to a customer. This make a cutomer wasting their time searching for a lowest price from all the middle man and the producer got their income cut due the middle man force the selling price to be lower than it should be. Our website will reinvented the system from a bottom up. First let start with the focus, our main focus will be the customer. The cuutomer will be the one who start the process. First cutomer will post the list of stuff they want on the website then the supplyier will be the one who offer the product and price to the customer. Then the customer will then be the one who choose what supplyier they want.
